Weather Data Analysis Report

Prepared for Prof. Amarnath Mitra

Date: 14/01/2024

Executive Summary:

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of weather data over a specified period. The analysis includes various weather parameters such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, as observed from the provided data. The purpose of this report is to provide valuable insights into weather patterns and their potential implications for decision-making.

Temperature Analysis:
The Temperature Line Plot reveals significant insights into daily temperature variations. The minimum daily temperature typically ranges from a comfortable 5°C to 20°C, while the maximum daily temperature reaches higher values, occasionally reaching around 35°C.

Inferences:

Temperature variations over time suggest changing weather conditions.
Consistently higher maximum temperatures than minimum temperatures indicate warmer days.
For instance, on day 50, the minimum temperature was approximately 10°C in the morning and increased to around 25°C in the afternoon.
Rainfall Analysis:
The Rainfall Bar Plot showcases the frequency and intensity of rainfall. Most days experience little to no rainfall, with values close to zero, indicating dry weather conditions. However, there are notable exceptions when heavy rainfall occurs, exceeding 50 mm.

Inferences:

Frequent days with no rainfall indicate predominantly dry weather.
Occasional heavy rainfall events may lead to flooding concerns.
For example, on day 75, there was a significant precipitation event with approximately 60 mm of rainfall.
Wind Speed Analysis:
The Wind Speed Scatter Plot highlights wind patterns at 9 am and 3 pm. It demonstrates that wind speeds vary throughout the dataset, with days ranging from calm to windy.

Inferences:

Wind speed fluctuations have implications for outdoor activities and safety.
Calm days offer favorable conditions for various outdoor operations.
On day 30, wind speed was around 10 km/h in the morning and increased to approximately 20 km/h in the afternoon.
Humidity Analysis:
The Humidity Area Plot presents changes in humidity levels at 9 am and 3 pm. It reveals that humidity levels exhibit different patterns during these times, with variations between morning and afternoon.

Inferences:

Differential morning and afternoon humidity levels affect comfort and well-being.
Higher humidity can impact outdoor activities and construction projects.
On day 20, humidity was around 60% at 9 am, but it decreased to approximately 40% at 3 pm.
Atmospheric Pressure Analysis:
The Pressure Box Plot illustrates variations in atmospheric pressure at 9 am and 3 pm. It highlights that pressure varies, with occasional outliers indicating unusual pressure conditions on specific days.

Inferences:

Fluctuations in atmospheric pressure may signal changing weather systems.
Understanding pressure trends can enhance weather predictions.
Atmospheric pressure typically ranged between 1010 hPa and 1020 hPa at 9 am, but outliers were observed on some days.
Morning Temperature Distribution:
The Temperature Histogram provides insights into the distribution of morning temperatures. Most mornings fall within a specific temperature range, with a peak around 20°C.

Inferences:

Concentrated morning temperatures indicate climate stability.
A peak around 20°C suggests a pleasant start to the day.
Mornings typically had temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making them comfortable for various activities.
Conclusion:

The analysis of weather data, with specific reference to the provided graphs, offers valuable insights into weather patterns and conditions over the specified period. These insights can be used to make informed decisions in various industries, including agriculture, transportation, energy management, and urban planning. Further analysis and correlation studies can be conducted to explore relationships between weather parameters and their impacts on specific sectors.

I recommend considering these weather insights when making decisions related to daily operations, resource allocation, and risk management.
